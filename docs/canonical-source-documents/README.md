# Canonical Source Documents

<!-- migrated from knowledge-base repo on 2025-04 -->

This directory contains structured canonical source documents that have been processed and formatted according to the Cognitive Infrastructure's canonical standards.

These documents serve as authoritative references for concepts, patterns, and anti-patterns in the knowledge base.

Each canonical source document contains:
- Metadata in frontmatter
- Structured sections with standardized formatting
- Cross-references to related concepts
- JSON twins stored in the meta-stack repository

Canonical source documents are typically created from source documents through the epistemic extraction process.
