# Recursive Ingestion Pattern

This document demonstrates a pattern for recursively processing draft documents and integrating them into a knowledge base.

## Problem

Organizations with complex knowledge bases face challenges when trying to integrate new content in a consistent, structured manner. Manual processes are error-prone and don't scale, while fully automated approaches may lack the necessary contextual understanding.

## Solution

Establish a self-scaling ingestion system with a dedicated staging area (like `/docs/pending/`) where draft documents can be submitted in a relatively unstructured form, then processed through a pipeline that:

1. Classifies content by type and purpose
2. Routes it to appropriate destinations
3. Applies canonical structure and formatting
4. Generates machine-readable representations
5. Updates indices and cross-references

## Implementation

The implementation requires:

- A staging directory for new content
- Classification algorithms to determine content type
- Transformation logic to apply canonical structure
- Validation mechanisms to ensure quality
- Cross-reference management to maintain relationships

<!-- TODO: Add example code showing how to implement this pattern -->
