# **Toolification: An Emerging Epistemological Concept**

**Toolification** is a term gaining traction to describe a pattern where people and organizations reflexively apply surface-level **tools** to complex structural problems. In an age of abundant apps, no-code solutions, and AI-driven platforms, *“toolification”* captures the tendency to reach for a quick technological fix instead of addressing underlying systemic issues. This research scan compiles existing usages of the term, related concepts, theoretical precedents, and considerations for framing “toolification” within a broader intellectual framework of cognitive infrastructure and operational intelligence. The goal is to legitimize and contextualize the concept for use in white papers, epistemic field guides, and design discourse.

## **Current Usage of “Toolification”**

Though not yet a mainstream term, “toolification” has appeared in various contexts:

- **Business Support Methodology:** The SEED organization uses *toolification* to describe its approach to enterprise development support. In a 2019 SEED blog, an advisor reflects on moving from imposing solutions to facilitating tools for entrepreneurs, calling this process “our toolified business support offering” . Here toolification means empowering users with frameworks and *tools* (like visual templates and workshops) rather than one-size-fits-all solutions. A SEED white paper outlines “4 shifts of Toolification towards next-generation business development support,” indicating a structured methodology rather than an ad-hoc fix .
- **Games and Gamification:** In academic literature, *“toolification of games”* has been proposed as a counterpart to gamification. Researchers Kurihara et al. (2019) define **Toolification of Games (ToG)** as *“achieving non-game purposes in the redundant spaces of existing games”* . In other words, games can be repurposed as **tools** for education, health, or other outcomes. This usage is domain-specific (treating games as tools) but shows the term’s flexibility in describing turning something into a utilitarian tool.
- **Technocratic Experience Design:** Perhaps the most pointed use of *toolification* is by design theorist Betti Marenko, who warns of *“the toolification of experience”* in a 2021 paper . Marenko describes a *“platform-driven technocratic shift”* where humans increasingly become *“machines’ little slaves”* (echoing Bruno Munari’s 1937 warning) . She calls this process the toolification of our lived experience – a condition in which every aspect of experience is mediated by tools and platforms. In her critique, *toolification* is tied to **technocratic logic** that prioritizes efficiency, instrumentalism, and solutionism . Marenko notes *“the tendency to see technology as nothing but pure instrumentality — the technical toolkit — is a fallacy”* . In this context, toolification is largely negative: it reduces human experience to *“workable tools”*, shifts responsibility onto users to constantly adapt, and stifles critical, theoretical inquiry in favor of pragmatic quick fixes .
- **Everyday Discourse:** Outside academia, the term occasionally pops up in blogs and forums. For example, Spanish UX designer Patricia Saco used *“herramientización del diseño”* (“toolification of design”) to lament how design’s value was reduced to using software tools rather than solving problems . This mirrors the broader concern that focusing on tools (Photoshop, Figma, etc.) eclipses fundamental skills. Such incidental uses suggest *toolification* resonates as a label for over-reliance on tools in various fields.

**Synthesis:** Across these usages, *toolification* generally refers to **turning something into a tool or treating tools as primary solutions**. Sometimes it’s presented positively (providing structured tools to empower others), but more often it’s a critique of shallow, tool-led thinking. Crucially, all usages acknowledge that *toolification changes behavior*: be it repurposing games for tasks, structuring support as tool-use, or diminishing experiential richness through platforms. This sets the stage for examining related patterns and deeper theoretical roots of this behavior.

## **Related Concepts and Patterns**

The phenomenon of *toolification* overlaps with several known terms that describe similar patterns of superficial or proliferating solutions:

- **Technological Solutionism:** Evgeny Morozov famously critiqued *“technological solutionism”* – the belief that we can app our way out of every problem . Solutionism is the mindset that **complex social issues have quick tech fixes**, often ignoring root causes. As one article explains, it’s the *“desire to jump on technological solutions as a quick and flawless way to solve complex real world problems”* . Toolification is essentially solutionism at the micro level: instead of addressing a structural or process problem, we reach for a new app, gadget, or AI tool as a band-aid. This is *“politically appealing”* – it **appears** to solve the issue and *“ticks all the right boxes”* of action, while sidestepping messy societal or organizational change . The result, as Morozov and others warn, is often a *mismatch* between the tool and the true problem, sometimes even causing harm .
- **“Shiny Tool” Syndrome (App Sprawl):** Modern organizations are experiencing **app sprawl**, also called *“app overload”* or *“stack sprawl.”* This refers to accumulating too many tools, platforms, and SaaS apps such that efficiency and clarity suffer . A 2024 CIO survey found 72% of CIOs are concerned about *app sprawl*, defined as *“the surge of different platforms used in the workplace”* leading to security risks and complexity . Every team adopts its own tool (often to solve a niche problem), and soon the organization has dozens of overlapping systems. *Toolification* drives this sprawl: instead of fixing a broken process or inter-department workflow, a new tool is layered on. Paradoxically, **AI may accelerate** this – with countless AI startups and no-code tools, CIOs worry *“there’s too many AI tools in the market…it’s confusing…hard to figure out which one to use”*, contributing further to sprawl . Thus, toolification and app sprawl go hand in hand, creating integration nightmares and *“hidden inefficiencies”* that *“ripple across operations”* .
- **Duct-Tape Solutions and Integration Debt:** A colloquial cousin of toolification is the *“duct-tape solution”* – a makeshift fix that holds things together temporarily. In software circles this is linked to **technical debt**: *“once you’ve started using figurative duct tape to fix problems, making further changes becomes increasingly difficult, so you add even more duct tape”* . Over time, these quick fixes accrue a cost – much like interest on debt – that must eventually be paid by a major refactoring . **Integration debt** is a related concept in IT, referring to the accumulated burden of wiring together many disparate tools in ad-hoc ways . Every new SaaS app or API you plug into your workflow might solve an immediate need, but it can create fragile dependencies. One industry article notes integration debt *“builds over time as more and more applications, systems and databases are brought into the landscape”*, to the point that **“disconnected tools” and manual glue work become a barrier to innovation** . In short, chasing tools can lead to a patchwork architecture that is *brittle* and hard to scale – a clear parallel to toolification in strategy: short-term convenience creates long-term complexity.
- **“Maslow’s Hammer” (Law of the Instrument):** On a cognitive level, toolification reflects the classic bias identified by Abraham Maslow and Abraham Kaplan. Often phrased as, *“if the only tool you have is a hammer, it is tempting to treat everything as a nail,”* this is the **law of the instrument** . It describes an over-reliance on familiar tools and methods, even when they’re not suited to the problem. In today’s context, the “hammer” might be an algorithm, a project management app, or a data dashboard. The *cognitive comfort* of using a tool we know can blind us to non-tool solutions. Thus, toolification can be seen as an expression of Maslow’s hammer at scale – organizations with a strong tech toolkit will try to solve every issue by deploying yet another tool. As Wikipedia succinctly notes, this bias is *“an over-reliance on a familiar tool”* or methodology . Recognizing this bias is key to countering toolification: it urges us to ask *is a new tool really the answer here, or are we just reaching for our hammer?*
- **“Shifting the Burden” Systems Archetype:** In systems-thinking terms, toolification aligns with what Peter Senge calls the *Shifting the Burden* archetype. This archetype describes the common habit of addressing a problem’s **symptom** with an immediate remedy, instead of pursuing a fundamental solution that is harder or slower to implement . The symptomatic fix (in our case, deploying a tool) provides quick relief but **does not solve the root cause**, and can even delay or undermine the fundamental fix . As one explainer puts it, *“this tendency leads us down the path of focusing on symptoms rather than on more fundamental causes”* . Over time, reliance on the quick fix can become **addictive** – the organization becomes ever more dependent on the growing toolkit, while the underlying problem (be it a broken process, lack of skill, or cultural issue) persists . The proliferation of tools can thus be seen as a **systems pathology**, where each new app is a palliative measure that postpones structural reform. Only by *“refocusing attention on the fundamental solution”* (e.g. redesigning the workflow, training people, changing policy) can the cycle be broken . In summary, toolification is the *symptomatic quick fix* incarnate.

Each of these related concepts highlights a different facet of toolification – be it the *ideological belief* in tech fixes, the *proliferation of tools* in practice, the *technical debt* it creates, or the *cognitive bias* driving it. Together they paint a picture of a prevalent pattern in modern operational thinking: when faced with a tough problem, we reach for a tool. Next, we examine where this pattern fits in the history of ideas about technology and knowledge.

## **Philosophical and Theoretical Precedents**

Toolification as a concept did not emerge in a vacuum. It echoes longstanding philosophical critiques of technology and instrumental reason. Key thinkers have explored why societies often prefer technical fixes and how tools relate to human agency:

- **Instrumentalism and Technocracy:** The idea that we might overshoot in treating all problems as technical stems from critiques of **technocracy** and instrumental rationality. In *Technopoly* (1992), Neil Postman described how a society can become enthralled by technology. He defines a *technopoly* as a culture that *“seeks its authorization in technology, finds its satisfactions in technology, and takes its orders from technology.”* In such a culture, there is a *“surplus of information generated by technology”* and **technological tools are then employed to cope with the problems caused by technology itself** . This feedback loop is essentially toolification on a societal scale – new tools to manage the complications from previous tools. Postman warned that in technopoly, *efficiency* becomes the paramount virtue and people come to imagine **“technology can do no wrong.”** The *toolification mindset* today (e.g. “there should be an app for everything”) is a direct descendant of what Postman and others identified as an **instrumentalist worldview**. Similarly, Langdon Winner and Jacques Ellul critiqued how modern societies turn every human goal into a technical problem to be optimized – reducing moral or political dilemmas into engineering challenges. Betti Marenko’s critique of the *“technocratic logic”* behind toolification of experience builds on this lineage: she notes it rests on *“instrumentalism – the idea that if [a technology] works, it must be good – and solutionism – the idea that technology can and should deliver a solution to every problem.”* . This logic, she argues, narrows our view and *“reduces any discussion around technology”* to simplistic terms . Thus, the epistemological danger of toolification has been philosophically anticipated as the dominance of technical reasoning over critical or ethical reasoning.
- **Ivan Illich’s Tools and Conviviality:** Ivan Illich was an early voice warning that **tools can rule their users** if society isn’t careful. In *Tools for Conviviality* (1973), he distinguished between *convivial tools* that empower people, and industrial tools that create dependence. Illich famously stated, *“people can be equally enslaved by their tools”* , arguing that past a certain point, the proliferation of high-powered tools actually undermines individual freedom and competence. For example, an over-“schooled” society might lose the ability to learn or teach informally; an over-medicalized society might lose community caregiving skills. This maps to toolification: the more we address every need via specialized tools, the more we risk **deskilling** ourselves or creating new dependencies. Illich’s solution was a *“convivial society”* where each person has *“free access to the tools of the community”* and technology remains within human control . His notion that *“what is right comes to be subordinated to what is efficient for institutions”* in an industrialized mindset resonates with today’s critique that organizations reach for tools that optimize metrics at the expense of less measurable values. Illich provides an ethical precedent to ask: are our tools serving us, or are we *serving* our tools? Toolification as a pathology clearly falls on the side of tools starting to dictate human behavior (needing to constantly adapt to new systems, retrain, upgrade, etc. ). In Illich’s terms, a balance must be struck so that tools remain **convivial** (enriching human autonomy) rather than industrial (imposing narrow demands).
- **James C. Scott and High-Modernist Schemes:** Political scientist James C. Scott analyzed why grand social schemes often fail in his book *Seeing Like a State* (1998). He identified **high-modernist ideology** as a key culprit – a *“muscle-bound self-confidence about scientific and technical progress…and above all, the rational design of social order commensurate with scientific understanding”* . High-modernism is essentially the belief that **for every social problem, there is a technical solution designed by experts**. Scott showed how this led to top-down projects (from collectivized farms to utopian city designs) that ignored local knowledge and complexities, often with disastrous results . Toolification can be seen as a micro-scale high-modernism: the belief that we can plug in a ready-made tool or system to “solve” a complex issue (whether it’s workplace collaboration or personal productivity). Scott stressed the importance of *metis* (practical, context-specific knowledge) which tends to be pushed aside by an overreliance on abstract tools and metrics. In modern organizations, this might translate to valuing a software dashboard’s numbers over frontline intuition. As Scott put it, *“designed social order is necessarily schematic; it always ignores essential features of any real, functioning system”* . A parallel in toolification is that adopting a generic tool often forces a schematic order onto a nuanced situation – potentially *mis-solving* the problem. Scott’s work serves as a historical caution: without **critical reflection and local input**, the drive to fix everything with designed systems (tools) can produce *“unintended side-effects that frequently undermine”* the original goals . Toolification should therefore be examined with the same healthy skepticism Scott applied to high-modernist development plans.
- **Douglas Engelbart’s Co-Evolution Principle:** Interestingly, not all precedents are cautionary. Computing pioneer Douglas Engelbart, while being an advocate for tools to *augment* human intellect, warned that tools alone are not a silver bullet. He introduced the idea of the **co-evolution of human systems and tool systems**. Engelbart observed that our capabilities are a combination of our **Human System** (skills, organizations, practices) and our **Tool System** (technologies, artifacts) . For augmentation to succeed, these must evolve in tandem. He noted that the *Tool System* was advancing rapidly, while *“the Human System is much slower to adapt”*, leading to a *“serious disconnect, a serious risk of de-augmentation.”* In other words, piling on new tools without upgrading our human processes and understanding can ironically make us **less effective** (what Engelbart calls “de-augmentation”). This insight strikes at the heart of toolification: the failure to co-evolve. Simply adding AI tools or no-code apps to an organization that hasn’t developed the culture or skills to integrate them can create chaos – the opposite of augmentation. Engelbart’s solution was a *bootstrapping strategy* where organizations *proactively improve how they improve*, aligning tool advances with practice/process advances . This provides a constructive framing: *toolification* becomes a problem when it’s **decoupled** from human systems evolution. The antidote is ensuring any new tool adoption is accompanied by learning, training, and perhaps simplification elsewhere. Engelbart’s work lends legitimacy to discussing toolification in terms of *maturity*: low-maturity teams keep adding tools (thinking tools alone create capability), high-maturity teams adjust the human-tool balance (focusing on workflow, standards, and only using tools that truly integrate).
- **Other Anchoring Ideas:** Marshall McLuhan’s adage *“We shape our tools, and thereafter our tools shape us”* succinctly captures the reciprocal nature of technology and cognition. The concept of *toolification* is essentially an observation of the second part – tools shaping our behavior and decisions, sometimes to our detriment. Likewise, Herbert A. Simon’s distinction between *“doing the right thing”* (effectiveness) and *“doing things right”* (efficiency) is relevant: toolification often biases toward **doing things right** (optimizing a task with a tool) even if we haven’t confirmed it’s the *right thing* to be doing. These precedents from systems theory, media theory, and design ethics all converge on a key epistemological point: **a bias toward tools can narrow our thinking**. It can obscure bigger questions of purpose, values, or alternative approaches that don’t fit neatly into a tool’s framework . Recognizing this, as thinkers like Illich and Postman did, is the first step in developing a critical language around toolification.

## **Non-English and Alternate Terminology**

The systemic behavior underlying *toolification* is not uniquely English, and some equivalent terms or translations are emerging:

- In **Spanish**, the neologism *herramientización* (from *herramienta* = tool) has been used in contexts similar to toolification. We saw it in a UX design critique . One could talk about *“la herramientización de la sociedad”* to mean society’s reduction of every problem to a tool-based solution. More formally, Spanish and French often use *instrumentalización* (instrumentalization) to critique treating social issues or people as mere instruments. While *instrumentalizar* usually implies exploiting something for an unrelated end, it overlaps with toolification in suggesting a loss of intrinsic perspective – e.g., *“la instrumentalización de la educación”* might describe how education policy focuses on test tools and neglects learning. Similarly, *solutionnisme technologique* is the French translation of technological solutionism, carrying the same meaning as Morozov’s term.
- In **German**, a direct translation of toolification might be *Toolifizierung* or *Instrumentalisierung*. These are not (yet) established terms in German discourse about tech, but Germans do discuss *“Technikgläubigkeit”* (technology faith) and *“Aktionismus”* (action-ism, i.e., doing something for the sake of it) in contexts where organizations implement tools just to appear modern. A phrase like *“Werkzeugansatz”* (tool approach) or simply using *“Lösungen von der Stange”* (off-the-shelf solutions) captures the similar notion of defaulting to generic tools. The **concept** seems universal even if the exact term varies.
- It’s worth noting that **gamification** – another “-ification” neologism – has readily entered multiple languages, suggesting *toolification* could as well if the concept proves useful. In Spanish one might say *“toolficación”* (not common, but conceivable by analogy to *gamificación*), in French perhaps *“outillisation”* (from *outil*, tool) or simply *“tout transformer en outil.”* For now, however, the usage of *toolification/herramientización* is nascent and tends to be explained in context rather than assumed known. Introducing it alongside more familiar terms (solutionism, etc.) can help bridge any language gaps.

## **Framing “Toolification” Strategically**

If one were to introduce *toolification* as a term of art in a white paper or diagnostic framework, there are several ways to strategically frame it:

- **As a Named Pattern or Anti-Pattern:** In the spirit of design patterns, *toolification* can be presented as a recurring **anti-pattern** in problem-solving and organizational behavior. For example: *“Teams falling into toolification implement new apps for each challenge without improving underlying processes.”* Naming the pattern makes it easier to spot. It could be included in an epistemic field guide as a cautionary tale next to other patterns like *“Shifting the Burden”* or *“Cargo Cult Agile”*. By giving it a name, you invite practitioners to ask “are we doing toolification here?” – a powerful reflective prompt.
- **As a Systems Pathology:** Building on systems thinking, toolification can be framed as a **pathology of system design**. It’s what happens when short feedback loops (immediate tool benefits) override long feedback loops (sustainable improvements). This framing allows use of systems diagrams or archetypes: e.g., a diagram showing a problem symptom -> quick tool fix -> temporary relief -> worsening underlying capability -> more problems -> more tool fixes (a reinforcing loop). Such a model resonates with those familiar with organizational learning and can be a diagnostic lens during project post-mortems or strategy sessions.
- **As a Cognitive Bias or Mindset:** Emphasize the psychological side by framing toolification as a **cognitive bias** that decision-makers should be aware of. Like *confirmation bias* or *status quo bias*, *toolification bias* could describe the reflexive assumption that adding a tool is the best solution. Including references to *Maslow’s hammer* drives home that this mindset is deeply human (we gravitate to known solutions). By labeling it a bias, one can introduce checklists or “red team” exercises to counter it – for instance, forcing a team to articulate a non-tool-based solution before deciding to adopt a new tool, just to ensure the bias is checked.
- **As a Diagnostic Lens in Maturity Models:** In capability maturity models (CMMI, etc.) or digital transformation roadmaps, one might characterize early maturity stages by ad-hoc tool usage and later stages by integrated, optimized toolsets. *Toolification* could be introduced as a stage that organizations often go through – a *“tool chaos”* phase where every department is adding apps (lots of activity, little alignment) before hopefully evolving to a more *rationalized tool ecosystem*. By framing it this way, the term isn’t a judgment so much as a neutral description of a phase to be managed. It becomes a lens for diagnosing where a team or org stands: *Are we in a toolification trap?* If so, the strategy should shift from *“more tools”* to *“consolidation and fundamentals.”* Analysts or consultants could even quantify toolification (e.g., *ratio of new tools adopted to problems actually solved*) as a metric to watch.
- *As a Socio-Technical **“Smell”****: Borrowing a term from software (“code smell”), toolification can be framed as an **organizational smell** – a warning sign that something deeper is amiss. For example, if a company has dozens of overlapping systems (a CRM, plus a plugin, plus a spreadsheet “tool” on the side), that *smells* like an underlying governance problem or lack of a coherent strategy. By highlighting toolification as a symptom, leaders can be guided to ask *“What are we avoiding or unable to address such that we keep adding tools? Is it a skills gap? A cultural fear of change? Siloed communication?”* In this way, toolification serves as a diagnostic flag: it directs attention to **underlying causes** once you acknowledge the pattern.

Each framing has a slightly different emphasis – pattern language speaks to designers/architects, pathology to systems engineers, bias to psychologists/behavioral economics, and maturity lens to managers. In an epistemic guide, one could even present these multiple framings to enrich the concept and show its versatility. The core message in any framing should be clear: *toolification is a trap to be aware of*. It doesn’t mean tools are bad – rather it means **using tools without intentionality or deeper change** is bad.

## **Assessing the Term’s Uniqueness and Suitability**

Is *“toolification”* the right term for formal adoption? Several points emerge from this research:

- **Clarity and Intuitiveness:** *Toolification* is fairly transparent in meaning – even without definition, one might guess it has to do with “making everything into a tool.” This intuitiveness is a strength; it’s akin to how *“gamification”* immediately suggests adding game-like elements. The term is *broad*, but in a useful way, because it can apply to mindsets, processes, or whole systems. With a brief context (e.g., *“the toolification of problem-solving”*), readers can grasp the critique quickly.
- **Uniqueness vs Overlap:** The concept overlaps with *technological solutionism* but is not identical. Solutionism is an overarching ideology, whereas *toolification* pinpoints the **mechanism** (the proliferation of tools) by which solutionism often manifests. It also overlaps with *instrumentalization*, but while instrumentalization is usually used in ethical contexts (treating people as tools), toolification focuses on **tools as solutions**. There doesn’t appear to be a single established term that covers exactly this niche. Terms like *“quick fix culture”* or *“silver-bullet thinking”* come close but lack the specific emphasis on tools and technology. In that sense, *toolification* fills a gap by giving a name to a growing phenomenon in the era of cloud software and AI assistants.
- **Formality and Tone:** Admittedly, *toolification* is a somewhat informal coinage (the suffix “-ification” can sound jargony or buzzwordy). It is not (yet) an academic term of art found in textbooks. However, many now-common concepts in tech and design started as informal neologisms. For instance, *“technosolutionism”* itself was popularized in journalism and critique, not as a scholarly term, yet it’s widely recognized. The key is to define the term explicitly when introducing it in a formal context, and to back it with credible sources (as we’ve done here). By citing thinkers like Postman, Illich, and Marenko, one anchors *toolification* in established theory, lending it legitimacy even if the word is new. In strategic writing, one might say: *“We label this pattern **toolification** – a term inspired by critiques of technological solutionism  and the observed ‘toolification of experience’ in digital culture .”* Such positioning signals that the term is a deliberate invention building on prior analysis.
- **Scope – Too Narrow or Too Broad?** The breadth of *toolification* can be double-edged. On one hand, it encapsulates a wide range of symptoms (from buying software for every issue, to using metrics as proxies for goals, to individuals relying on apps for basic tasks). This breadth is useful for high-level discussions (*“Our organization as a whole is suffering from toolification”*). On the other hand, if not scoped, it could be *too broad*, potentially conflating distinct problems. To mitigate this, one could define subtypes or domain-specific instances. For example: *“Productivity toolification”* for individuals who use dozens of productivity apps with little effect, or *“policy toolification”* for governments launching tech apps to solve social problems (like the ill-fated consent app example of techno-solutionism ). The term is flexible enough to allow such refinement. Far from being too narrow, the risk is using it as a catch-all pejorative. Care should be taken to use it when a true pattern of superficial tool-reliance is observed, rather than as a generic insult to any use of tools.
- **Resonance with Current Trends:** The timing for adopting *toolification* formally may be ideal. We’re at a point where no-code tools let **non-engineers churn out new apps** overnight, AI assistants promise to handle all tasks, and organizations are drowning in software subscriptions. There is a growing awareness (especially post-2020’s remote work boom) that too many tools can be a problem – evidenced by CIO surveys on app sprawl and mainstream articles about “tool fatigue.” A term like *toolification* could quickly resonate with professionals who have felt the frustration of constantly adopting new tools without seeing better outcomes. It provides a concise way to critique that trend. The novelty of the word also gives it a bit of *catchiness*, which can aid memetic spread in design and strategy circles.

In conclusion, *toolification* as a term appears **well-suited for strategic and epistemological use** so long as it’s clearly defined. It captures a real and observed pattern in modern cognitive infrastructure: the lure of the tool-driven quick fix. By anchoring it in existing theory (solutionism, instrumental rationality) and illustrating it with contemporary examples (app sprawl, AI tool glut), one can make a compelling case for its relevance. The term is broad enough to cover multi-domain phenomena yet specific enough to denote a distinct mindset. Its slightly informal nature can be a feature in design-adjacent discourse, which often invents terminology for complex phenomena (e.g., “dark patterns” in UX). Ultimately, the *fitness* of “toolification” will be proven by its utility – if thinkers and practitioners find that it fills a linguistic gap and helps diagnose a problem, it will stick. This research indicates a strong case for that utility.

## **Conclusion and Citational Anchors**

The exploration of *toolification* reveals it as a multifaceted concept interlinking technology, psychology, and systems theory. By surveying how the term is already used and connecting it with kindred ideas (from **technological solutionism**  to Illich’s warnings about being *“enslaved by [our] tools”* ), we’ve built a foundation that lends the term intellectual credibility. We see that the *toolification* habit – **solving structural problems with surface-level tools** – is pervasive and problematic, yet also addressable with mindful strategy.

Introducing *toolification* into discourse can serve as a wake-up call, much like Neil Postman’s Technopoly served in 1992. It gives a name to the creeping feeling many have that *“we have too many tools and not enough solutions.”* Used as a diagnostic, it can prompt the necessary *critical reflection* Marenko urges – ensuring we don’t let the convenience of tools eclipse the hard work of theory, critique, and fundamental change . As we integrate this term into white papers and design guides, the provided citational anchors reinforce that we’re not just coining buzzwords; we’re extending a conversation that thinkers have been engaged in for decades about **means and ends** in the human-tool relationship.

In summary, *toolification* is both a symptom of our tech-enabled era and a concept through which we can better understand our cognitive and operational infrastructure. By learning from its historical precedents and related patterns, we can use the term strategically – not to dismiss tools, but to advocate for more **intentional tool use**. In an environment where *“not everything needs to be an app”*  and quick fixes often fail, naming the pattern of toolification is a first step toward more resilient, thoughtful problem-solving.
