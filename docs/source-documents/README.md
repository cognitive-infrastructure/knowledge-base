# Source Documents

<!-- migrated from knowledge-base repo on 2025-04 -->

This directory contains original source documents before they are processed into canonical form.

Source documents may include:
- Research papers
- Meeting notes
- Draft concepts
- Original writings before canonicalization

These documents serve as the raw material for the epistemic extraction process, which transforms them into canonical source documents that can be integrated into the knowledge base.
