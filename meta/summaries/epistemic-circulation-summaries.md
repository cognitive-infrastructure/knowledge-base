# Epistemic Circulation Document Summaries

This file contains standardized summaries for the epistemic circulation concept and related documents.

## Core Concept: Epistemic Circulation

### Short Summary (1-2 sentences)
The architecture of intelligence flow that enables structured knowledge to remain coherent as it moves across agents, contexts, and time.

### Medium Summary (2-3 paragraphs)
Epistemic Circulation defines how intelligence maintains integrity while flowing through creation, structuring, publishing, retrieval, and evolution across different contexts. It provides the architectural principles for designing systems where intelligence doesn't merely accumulate but compounds through recursive improvement.

This concept addresses the fundamental mechanisms that enable knowledge to cross boundaries between human cognition, organizational structures, and artificial intelligence while preserving meaning and supporting evolution. By designing for circulation rather than storage, we create intelligence systems that improve through use rather than degrade through time.

## Canonical Source: Epistemic Circulation

### Short Summary (1-2 sentences)
Defining the architectonic principles governing how intelligence maintains coherence as it flows through creation, structuring, publishing, retrieval, and evolution across human and machine contexts.

### Medium Summary (2-3 paragraphs)
This canonical source document establishes the fundamental principles, structural foundations, transitional protocols, flow dynamics, and evolutionary mechanics that govern effective intelligence flow. It represents a shift from treating knowledge as static assets to recognizing intelligence as a dynamic flow requiring deliberate architectural support.

The document provides a comprehensive framework for intelligence architects, knowledge designers, infrastructure engineers, AI system builders, and organizational strategists to design systems where intelligence maintains clarity, builds upon itself, and adapts to changing contexts. It addresses intelligence circulation across layers, boundaries, modalities, and time scales to create systems where knowledge doesn't just accumulate but continuously clarifies and evolves.

## Diagnostic: Intelligence Circulation

### Short Summary (1-2 sentences)
A comprehensive diagnostic framework for identifying, measuring, and addressing breakdowns in intelligence flow across systems, contexts, and time.

### Medium Summary (2-3 paragraphs)
This diagnostic framework addresses how intelligence circulation frequently breaks down in ways that are difficult to identify and address without targeted diagnostic methods. It systematically examines failure modes including structural occlusions, interface resistance, semantic dilution, retrieval collapse, and evolution stagnation that impede effective intelligence flow.

The document provides practical tools for diagnosing circulation health, observable patterns and signals of dysfunction, and detailed remediation strategies for restoring proper flow. Through case studies spanning organizational knowledge architecture, AI-assisted knowledge work, and personal knowledge management, it demonstrates how effective diagnosis and intervention can transform circulation failure into compound intelligence development.
