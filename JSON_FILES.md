# JSON Metadata Files

## IMPORTANT: JSON Files Are Located in meta-stack

All JSON metadata files for the knowledge-base documents are stored in the **meta-stack** repository.

## Location

You can find the JSON metadata files at:
- GitHub: https://github.com/cognitive-infrastructure/meta-stack/tree/main/json
- Local: ../meta-stack/json/

## Structure

The JSON files follow the same directory structure as this knowledge-base:
- `meta-stack/json/core-concepts/` - For core concepts
- `meta-stack/json/docs/canonical-source-documents/` - For canonical source documents
- `meta-stack/json/diagnostics/` - For diagnostic frameworks
- And so on...

## Why?

This separation ensures:
1. Centralized metadata management
2. Consistent validation against schemas
3. Single source of truth for structured data
4. Simplified querying and indexing

## Questions?

See the README in meta-stack/json for more details on the JSON structure and organization.
