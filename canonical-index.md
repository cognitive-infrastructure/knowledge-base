# Canonical Concepts in Cognitive Infrastructure

## Architectural Patterns

1. **Modal Layer Architecture** — Five‑layer model (Data, Logic, Interface, Orchestration, Feedback) that keeps operational intelligence evolvable by maintaining clear boundaries between concerns.

2. **Structure-Memory-Interaction** — Fundamental triad enabling persistent, evolvable intelligence through clear organization, reliable recall, and meaningful engagement.

3. **Role-Structure Coherence** — Alignment of responsibilities with supporting scaffolding, ensuring that roles have the architectural support needed to function effectively.

4. **Multi-Axis Integration** — Framework for achieving coherence across vertical (hierarchical), horizontal (functional), and end-to-end (sequential) dimensions.

5. **[Hero-Structure Inverse Correlation Law](library/core-concepts/hero-structure-inverse-correlation-law-canonical-source.md)** — Fundamental relationship where the operational dependence on individual heroism within a system is inversely proportional to the structural maturity of that system (H = k/S).

## Implementation Patterns

1. **Canonical IDs** — Create stable, globally unique identifiers for entities and concepts that transcend specific systems.

2. **Closed-Loop Feedback** — Design measurement systems that immediately inform adjustments through clear action pathways.

3. **Layered Modularity** — Align system boundaries with the five Modal Layers so each can evolve independently.

4. **Progressive Typing** — Begin with flexible data structures that tighten as understanding grows, balancing exploration with eventual consistency.

5. **Return Path Engineering** — Design explicit routes back to previous knowledge and contexts, enabling compound intelligence through revisitation.

6. **Semantic Foundation** — Establish unified definitions, relationships, and business rules that create consistent meaning across systems and teams.

7. **Single Source of Truth** — Establish authoritative entity records from which all other representations derive.

## Diagnostic Concepts

1. **[Structural Debt](library/core-concepts/structure-debt-canonical-source.md)** — Accumulated cost of misaligned operational architecture, manifesting as fractured data models, inconsistent business rules, and disconnected workflows.

2. **[Coherence Debt](library/core-concepts/coherence-debt-canonical-source.md)** — Cumulative deficit in shared meaning, narrative alignment, and interpretive trust that arises when a system's data, language, or purpose diverges across its actors.

3. **[Epistemophany](library/core-concepts/epistemophany-canonical-source.md)** — The moment when a person or system perceives the structural architecture that has been shaping their understanding.

4. **[Structural Receptivity](library/core-concepts/structural-receptivity-canonical-source.md)** — A system's capacity to incorporate new knowledge into its architecture without fragmentation.

5. **[Semantic Friction](library/core-concepts/semantic-friction-canonical-source.md)** — The resistance encountered when attempting to translate meaning across boundaries in knowledge systems.

## Anti-Patterns

1. **[Ballup](library/patterns-and-anti-patterns/anti-patterns/ballup-canonical-source.md)** — Chronic recurring issues despite repeated attempts to fix them.

2. **[Cognitive Amnesia](library/patterns-and-anti-patterns/anti-patterns/cognitive-amnesia-canonical-source.md)** — Organizations repeatedly solving the same problems without building on past solutions.

3. **Dashboard Theater** — Impressive-looking visualizations that mask underlying data and logic weaknesses.

4. **[Hero Syndrome](library/patterns-and-anti-patterns/anti-patterns/hero-syndrome-canonical-source.md)** — Critical operations dependent on specific individuals rather than system structure.

5. **[Metastable Intelligence](library/patterns-and-anti-patterns/anti-patterns/metastable-intelligence-canonical-source.md)** — Systems that appear intelligent and functional until stress reveals their hidden structural fragilities.

6. **Semantic Drift** — Gradual divergence of terminology meaning across teams and systems.

7. **[Toolification](library/patterns-and-anti-patterns/anti-patterns/toolification-canonical-source.md)** — Pattern in which structural friction is met with the rapid adoption of additional tools instead of architectural redesign.

8. **[Trigger Chaos](library/patterns-and-anti-patterns/anti-patterns/trigger-chaos-canonical-source.md)** — Complex automations operating through invisible logic creating unpredictable outcomes.

9. **[Metric Mirage](library/patterns-and-anti-patterns/anti-patterns/metric-mirage-canonical-source.md)** — Systemic anti-pattern in which measurements proliferate without influencing behavior or driving adaptation.

## Diagnostic Frameworks

1. **Friction Ontology** — Taxonomy of recurring patterns where intelligence systems resist clarity, providing diagnostic tools for identifying and addressing structural issues.

2. **[Epistemic Substrate Theory](library/core-concepts/epistemic-substrate-theory-canonical-source.md)** — The foundational architecture that determines the possible forms, connections, persistence, and evolution of knowledge within any system of intelligence.

## Developmental Frameworks

1. **[Universal Evolutionary Stages](library/core-concepts/universal-evolutionary-stages-canonical-source.md)** — Eight-stage progression from fragmentation to integrated intelligence, mapping the common developmental sequence across domains.

2. **Continuity-Disruption Balance** — Framework for managing the tension between stability and evolution, enabling safe transformation without system collapse.

## Epistemological Constructs

1. **Return-as-Intelligence** — Recognition that revisiting and recontextualizing understanding is a core mechanism for intelligence evolution, not mere maintenance.

2. **Clarity Laws** — Empirical rules governing operational system behavior, revealing how structural constraints determine capability limits and evolution potential.

## Document Types

### Canonical Library

The `/library/` folder contains the structured canon of the Cognitive Infrastructure knowledge base, including:

- `/library/core-concepts/`: foundational ideas and principles
- `/library/frameworks/`: structured models and systems
- `/library/patterns-and-anti-patterns/`: recurring structures of success or failure
- `/library/diagnostics/`: tools for system assessment and friction tracing
- `/library/essays/`: narrative and philosophical reflections on intelligence architecture
- `/library/lexicon/`: original terms and metaphors with epistemic significance

All contents in this folder follow canonical formatting, versioning, and bidirectional referencing standards.

### Epistemological Source Documents

Epistemological source documents, located in `sources/`, provide research and external references rather than definitive concept descriptions. They explore the broader implications and connections of concepts within the field.

Currently available:
- [Toolification: An Emerging Epistemological Concept](sources/toolification-epistemological-source.md)
