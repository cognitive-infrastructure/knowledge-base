# Patterns & Anti‑Patterns

Architecture lives in recurring shapes.  
*Patterns* capture designs that preserve clarity. *Anti‑patterns* (frictions) describe structures that erode it.

## Using This Library
1. Diagnose your system → identify a pattern or anti‑pattern.  
2. Follow the "Forces → Remedies" table to decide interventions.  
3. Contribute improvements via pull‑request (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`).
