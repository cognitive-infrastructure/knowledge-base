# Semantic Drift

START_DEFINITION
Semantic Drift describes the gradual divergence in meaning of key terms and concepts across teams, systems, and time. This anti-pattern emerges when terms begin with shared understanding but evolve differently in separate contexts, causing increasing misalignment, communication failures, and integration challenges as differences compound over time.
END_DEFINITION

## Symptoms

- **Translation Multiplication**: Teams spend increasing time explaining what terms mean
- **Qualification Creep**: People add qualifiers to terms ("I mean *true* customers...")
- **Resolution Meetings**: Regular meetings needed to resolve definition disagreements
- **Integration Friction**: Data mapping becomes increasingly complex between systems
- **Broken Metrics**: Same metrics produce different results in different departments
- **Trust Erosion**: People doubt information reliability due to term confusion

## Causes

- **Absent Canonical Definitions**: No authoritative source of meaning for key terms
- **Siloed Evolution**: Terms evolve independently within team boundaries
- **Tribal Knowledge**: Definitions live in people's heads rather than explicit documentation
- **Shadow Meanings**: Teams create private interpretations of official terms
- **Context Loss**: Original meaning context is forgotten as organizations change
- **Pressure Shortcuts**: Implementation speed prioritized over semantic consistency

## Forces

- **Speed vs. Precision**: Pressure to deliver quickly discourages definitional work
- **Local vs. Global**: Local optimization creates terminology that serves immediate team needs
- **Freedom vs. Standards**: Natural language resists standardization attempts
- **Evolution vs. Stability**: Terms naturally evolve but systems need stability

## Consequences

- **Data Quality Erosion**: Inconsistent meanings lead to inconsistent data
- **Collaboration Friction**: Cross-team work requires constant term negotiation
- **Technical Debt Accumulation**: Systems codify divergent meanings, requiring complex mappings
- **Decision Impedance**: Information can't flow efficiently to decision points
- **Analysis Paralysis**: Competing definitions prevent clear conclusions

## Remedies

1. **Semantic Foundation**: Establish a shared glossary of canonical definitions
2. **Governance Process**: Create explicit ownership and evolution for key terms
3. **Pattern Detection**: Monitor for terminology divergence across teams
4. **Linguistic Mapping**: Document relationship between legacy and canonical terms
5. **Visualization**: Make semantic models visible and accessible
6. **Canonical IDs**: Establish precise identifiers that transcend terminological drift

## Examples

- A company where "active user" has seven different definitions across departments
- A healthcare system where "patient visit" is calculated differently by billing, clinical, and analytics teams
- A product where feature names mean different things in marketing, support, and engineering
