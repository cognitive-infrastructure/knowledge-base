# Cognitive Amnesia

"Didn't we solve this exact problem last year?"

| Section | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| **Symptoms** | Organization repeatedly solves the same problems; valuable insights fade rather than compound; past decisions are revisited without reference to previous reasoning; teams reinvent solutions that already exist elsewhere. |
| **Root Cause** | Memory mechanisms focus on storage rather than retrieval; context lost between solution instances; documentation that captures what but not why; missing connection between related problem occurrences. |
| **Impact** | Wasted effort recreating known solutions; inconsistent approaches to similar problems; inability to learn from experience at organizational scale; knowledge assets that grow in size but not in value. |
| **Structural Cure** | Implement Return Path Engineering pattern to create explicit revisitation routes. Build problem-solution repositories with rich contextual metadata. Create connection mechanisms between related issues across time. Design deliberate learning cycles that explicitly incorporate historical perspective. |
| **Quick Fixes (Stop-Gaps)** | Create simple issue pattern recognition guide. Assign "organizational memory" role in key meetings. Implement basic context capture templates. Schedule recurring retrospectives specifically focused on pattern recognition across time. |
| **Related Frictions** | Hero Syndrome, Ballup |
