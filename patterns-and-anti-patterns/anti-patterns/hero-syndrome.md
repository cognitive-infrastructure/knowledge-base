# Hero Syndrome

"Everything works fine as long as Sarah is here to fix it."

| Section | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| **Symptoms** | Operations depend on specific individuals; anxiety when key people take vacation; long onboarding times as tribal knowledge transfers slowly; resistance to system changes due to fragile understanding. |
| **Root Cause** | Critical knowledge and process control exist in people's heads rather than system structure; operational complexity exceeds documentation; institutional memory substitutes for architectural clarity. |
| **Impact** | Scaling bottlenecks as hero capacity limits growth; burnout among critical individuals; retention risk with catastrophic knowledge loss potential; increasing workarounds as heroes compensate for structural issues. |
| **Structural Cure** | Implement knowledge externalization program to document tribal knowledge. Build structural memory through explicit process definitions and decision criteria. Create learning pathways that systematically distribute expertise. Apply Role-Structure Coherence to align responsibilities with supporting systems. |
| **Quick Fixes (Stop-Gaps)** | Implement pairing protocols to spread knowledge. Create "break glass" runbooks for critical hero-dependent processes. Establish backup roles with scheduled rotation. Record hero problem-solving sessions for later reference. |
| **Related Frictions** | Cognitive Amnesia, Ballup |
