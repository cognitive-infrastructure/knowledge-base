# Semantic Foundation

START_DEFINITION
The Semantic Foundation pattern establishes shared definitions and conceptual models before automating processes or building systems. It ensures all stakeholders operate from common understanding, preventing misalignment and semantic drift as complexity increases. This pattern prioritizes definitional clarity as infrastructure rather than as documentation added later.
END_DEFINITION

## Intent

To create a shared foundational layer of meaning that all subsequent logic, processes, and interfaces can build upon with minimal translation loss.

## Context

This pattern is essential when:
- Multiple stakeholders must collaborate across boundaries
- Systems need to evolve while maintaining coherence 
- Complex knowledge must be made accessible to different audiences
- Business rules depend on precise interpretation of concepts

## Forces

- **Speed vs. Clarity**: Pressure to build quickly conflicts with need for definitional precision
- **Evolution vs. Stability**: Terms must remain consistent yet adapt to changing understanding
- **Technical vs. Domain**: Engineers and domain experts use different language for same concepts
- **Abstraction vs. Specificity**: Terms must be general enough for reuse but specific enough for precision

## Solution

Create an explicit semantic foundation through these steps:

1. **Identify Core Concepts**: Map the essential entities and relationships that form your domain
2. **Create Canonical Definitions**: Establish precise, stable definitions with examples and counterexamples
3. **Build Relationship Models**: Define how concepts relate to each other (hierarchies, dependencies, etc.)
4. **Establish a Governance Process**: Define how definitions evolve and who maintains semantic authority
5. **Surface Visibly**: Make this foundation accessible and visible, not buried in documentation

## Implementation

Implementation typically involves:

- A concept dictionary or glossary with canonical definitions
- Relationship diagrams showing how concepts connect
- Examples illustrating boundary cases and proper usage
- A change process for evolving definitions while maintaining integrity
- Training to ensure shared understanding across teams

## Consequences

### Benefits
- Prevents costly misalignments between teams and systems
- Creates a foundation for long-term knowledge building
- Reduces translation loss at organizational boundaries
- Makes complex domains accessible to new team members

### Tradeoffs
- Requires upfront investment before visible progress
- May appear bureaucratic in fast-moving environments
- Requires ongoing governance to prevent drift
- Can be challenging to balance precision with usability

## Examples

- A financial institution establishing canonical definitions of "customer," "account," and "transaction" before building a new platform
- A healthcare organization creating a shared ontology of medical concepts across departments
- A software company defining interface boundaries and data contract semantics before distributing work
