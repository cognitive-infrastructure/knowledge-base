# Layered Modularity

**Intent** Align system boundaries with the five Modal Layers so each can evolve independently.

| Section | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| **Context** | Complex systems with rapid change requirements, cross-functional teams, growing technical debt. |
| **Problem** | Interleaved concerns make safe refactoring impossible; changes to interfaces require rebuilding business logic; data structure changes break visualizations. |
| **Forces** | Time-to-market pressure vs. architectural integrity, team specialization, legacy system constraints, incremental funding models. |
| **Solution** | Enforce clear ownership boundaries around each Modal Layer. Ensure interfaces only cross adjacent layers through well-defined contracts. Allow specialized teams to optimize within layers while maintaining strict cross-layer protocols. |
| **Resulting Context** | Predictable change surface with isolated impacts; simpler mental models for each layer; reduced cross-team dependencies; foundation for continuous evolution without system-wide rewrites. |
| **Signals of Success** | Deployment diffs rarely touch more than one layer; reduced integration testing time; ability to replace components within layers without disrupting others; declining emergency fix frequency. |
| **Anti-Patterns Prevented** | Over-Layering, Trigger Chaos |
