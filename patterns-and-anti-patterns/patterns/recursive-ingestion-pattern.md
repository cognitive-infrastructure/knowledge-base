# Recursive Ingestion Pattern

<!-- migrated from knowledge-base repo on 2025-04 -->

## Problem

Organizations with complex knowledge bases face challenges when trying to integrate new content in a consistent, structured manner. Manual processes are error-prone and don't scale, while fully automated approaches may lack the necessary contextual understanding.

## Solution

Establish a self-scaling ingestion system with a dedicated staging area (like `/docs/pending/`) where draft documents can be submitted in a relatively unstructured form, then processed through a pipeline that:

1. Classifies content by type and purpose
2. Routes it to appropriate destinations
3. Applies canonical structure and formatting
4. Generates machine-readable representations
5. Updates indices and cross-references

## Implementation

The implementation requires:

- A staging directory for new content
- Classification algorithms to determine content type
- Transformation logic to apply canonical structure
- Validation mechanisms to ensure quality
- Cross-reference management to maintain relationships

The process can be implemented as a sequence of steps:

1. **Content Submission**: Provide a simple entry point for adding draft content.
2. **Classification**: Analyze the content to determine its type and purpose.
3. **Structural Transformation**: Apply standard templates and validate against schemas.
4. **Integration**: Move the content to its final destination and update cross-references.
5. **Validation**: Ensure all content meets quality and consistency requirements.

## Examples

This pattern is implemented in the Cognitive Infrastructure repositories through the four-step process:

1. Epistemic Extraction
2. Canonical Entry Generation
3. Upsert Pending Documents
4. Cross-Referencing Pass

Each step in this process handles a specific aspect of content integration, ensuring that new knowledge is properly structured, validated, and connected to existing concepts.

## Related Concepts

- **Structural Receptivity**: This pattern enhances the system's ability to incorporate new knowledge.
- **Semantic Foundation**: Ensures consistent terminology and meaning across integrated content.
- **Return Path Engineering**: Creates explicit routes back to previous knowledge contexts.
