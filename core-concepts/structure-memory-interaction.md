START_DEFINITION
The SMI Triad defines how usable intelligence emerges from three essential components: organization of information (Structure), ability to access past states (Memory), and systems that continuously refine understanding through usage patterns (Interaction). Together, these create the necessary conditions for knowledge systems that retain clarity, learn, and evolve coherently over time.
END_DEFINITION

## Why It Matters

Without all three elements in balance, knowledge systems degrade rather than evolve. Structure without memory becomes rigid doctrine; memory without interaction becomes dead archives; interaction without structure becomes noise. Organizations that maintain alignment across all three dimensions create self-improving intelligence; those that don't accumulate technical and semantic debt.

## Key Principles

1. **Structural Alignment**: Information architecture must reflect underlying reality to prevent semantic drift.
2. **Return Accessibility**: Memory systems must make previous states accessible with minimal friction.
3. **Integrative Interaction**: Usage patterns should recursively refine both structure and memory through closed feedback loops.
4. **Coherence Conservation**: The three elements must maintain alignment to prevent information entropy.
5. **Modal Separation**: Each component requires distinct design patterns yet must integrate seamlessly at boundaries.

## Implementation

Implementing the SMI Triad requires attention to all three components:

- **For Structure**: Design clear taxonomies, ensure consistent naming conventions, and establish canonical references.
- **For Memory**: Create explicit version control, implement search functionality, and maintain stable identifiers.
- **For Interaction**: Deploy feedback mechanisms, track usage patterns, and build closed-loop refinement processes.

The triad must be balanced—over-investing in one area while neglecting others creates brittle systems that cannot adapt.
