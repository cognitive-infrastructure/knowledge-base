START_DEFINITION  
**Return-as-Intelligence** inverts conventional models by recognizing that revisiting, reengaging, and recontextualizing previous understanding is not merely maintenance but a core mechanism through which intelligence compounds and evolves.
END_DEFINITION

## Why It Matters
Most systems optimize for initial capture and creation without deliberate pathways back to previous thinking. This creates accumulation without depth—growing collections of disconnected insights rather than evolving understanding. By designing explicitly for meaningful return, organizations transform static knowledge repositories into living intelligence systems that become more valuable through use rather than deteriorating.

## Key Principles
1. **From Capture to Return** - Shift design focus from efficient information collection to enabling meaningful reengagement, creating not just storage but retrieval architectures.
2. **Strategic Revisitation** - Not all information warrants equal return investment; distinguish between reference material (needs findability) and evolutionary material (needs engagement pathways).
3. **Context Restoration** - Effective return requires restoring not just content but intention, constraints, and surrounding thought—the original frame that made information meaningful.
4. **Layered Interaction** - Design for multiple return depths: quick reference (minimal context), deeper review (moderate restoration), and fundamental reengagement (complete reimmersion).
5. **Return Path Engineering** - Explicitly design the routes, triggers, and interfaces that enable return, treating them as core infrastructure rather than incidental features.
