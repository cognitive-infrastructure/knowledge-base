START_DEFINITION  
**Epistemophany** is the moment when a person or system perceives the structural architecture that has been shaping their understanding—a revelation of the previously invisible cognitive infrastructure that enables and constrains what can be known, triggering a recursive awareness that fundamentally changes how the system processes all subsequent information.
END_DEFINITION

## Why It Matters
Epistemophany represents a fundamental recursive turn in knowledge development—the moment when knowledge about structures of knowing becomes available to the knower. This recursive awareness creates the possibility for intentional evolution of knowledge architecture rather than mere content accumulation, enabling systems to see beyond content to the contexts that shape what can be known.

## Key Principles
1. **Infrastructure Revelation** – Epistemophany reveals the previously invisible cognitive foundations that have been shaping understanding, making the substrate of thought suddenly perceptible.
2. **Recursive Awareness** – The system gains the ability to perceive its own perceptual structures, creating a feedback loop that allows for higher-order cognitive evolution.
3. **Transformative Reframing** – After epistemophany, questions shift from content-focused to structure-focused, allowing for architectural rather than merely informational evolution.
4. **Coherence Restructuring** – The revelation enables reorganization of knowledge based on deeper structural understanding rather than surface categorization.
5. **Threshold Transition** – Epistemophany represents a non-linear shift in understanding—not incremental learning but a qualitative change in how learning itself occurs.

## Developmental Stages
1. **Pre-epistemophanic** – Acceptance of structural constraints as natural; focus on content rather than architecture.
2. **Threshold** – Growing friction; increased questioning; sense of limitation; tension between old and new understanding.
3. **Epistemophanic** – Sudden clarity about structural constraints; vocabulary shift; desire for architectural change; potential disorientation.
4. **Post-epistemophanic** – Integration of structural awareness; architectural language; desire for redesign; potential rejection of previous approaches.
