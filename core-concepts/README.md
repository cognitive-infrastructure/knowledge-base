# Core Concepts

> *"You can't evolve what you can't articulate."*  
> *— Field Axiom #1*

Cognitive Infrastructure rests on a small set of first‑principles.  
Each concept below is a **source‑of‑truth definition**: short enough to read in one sitting, stable enough to cite, and versioned for evolution.

| Concept | One‑Line Essence |
|---------|------------------|
| **[Structure–Memory–Interaction (SMI) Triad](structure-memory-interaction.md)** | Usable intelligence = organisation + return + recursive refinement. |
| **[Modal Layer Architecture](modal-layer-architecture.md)** | Data → Logic → Interface → Orchestration → Feedback. Five separable, integ­ratable layers. |
| **[Clarity Laws](clarity-laws.md)** | Empirical rules on how structure constrains capability. |
| **[Structural Debt](structural-debt.md)** | Hidden cost of mis‑aligned architecture; grows like interest. |
| **[Friction Ontology](friction-ontology.md)** | Taxonomy of recurring clarity frictions. |
| **[Multi‑Axis Integration](multi-axis-integration.md)** | Vertical, horizontal, end‑to‑end coherence across organisations. |
| **[Continuity–Disruption Balance](continuity-disruption-balance.md)** | Safely evolving systems without breaking trust. |
| **[Universal Evolutionary Stages](universal-evolutionary-stages.md)** | 0–7 maturity ladder from fragmentation to integrated intelligence. |
| **[Role–Structure Coherence](role-structure-coherence.md)** | Responsibility must match the scaffold that supports it. |
| **[Return‑as‑Intelligence](return-as-intelligence.md)** | Revisiting understanding is itself a generative act. |
| **[Epistemophany](epistemophany.md)** | The moment when a system perceives the architecture shaping its understanding. |
| **[Coherence Debt](coherence-debt.md)** | Cumulative deficit in shared meaning and interpretive trust. |
| **[Structural Receptivity](structural-receptivity.md)** | System's capacity to incorporate new knowledge without fragmentation. |
| **[Epistemic Substrate Theory](epistemic-substrate-theory.md)** | Foundational architecture determining possible forms of knowledge. |

## Canonical Source Documents

For more comprehensive exploration of these concepts, refer to the canonical source documents in the `library/core-concepts/` directory. These documents provide in-depth treatments including:

- Theoretical underpinnings and foundational thinkers
- Diagnostic frameworks and severity gradients
- Linguistic variations and cross-lingual analogues
- Narrative metaphors and illustrative scenes
- Cultural and economic implications
