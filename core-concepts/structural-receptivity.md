START_DEFINITION  
**Structural Receptivity** is a system's capacity to incorporate new knowledge into its architecture without fragmentation, measured by how effectively new information integrates with rather than accumulates alongside existing structures, maintaining or enhancing coherence while reducing rather than increasing friction over time.
END_DEFINITION

## Why It Matters
Structural receptivity suggests that the capacity to integrate new knowledge depends more on architectural properties than on content processing capabilities, and that evolution requires not just adding information but ensuring architecture can coherently incorporate it. This capacity determines whether systems become more or less coherent as they encounter novelty and incorporate new knowledge, shifting focus from simple expansion to architectural evolution.

## Key Principles
1. **Integration vs. Accumulation** – Receptive systems connect new knowledge to existing structures rather than merely piling information alongside them, creating enrichment rather than complexity.
2. **Coherence Maintenance** – Systems with high receptivity preserve or enhance overall coherence when incorporating novelty rather than developing internal contradictions or fragmentation.
3. **Friction Dynamics** – The effort required to incorporate new knowledge decreases rather than increases over time in receptive systems, indicating sustainable architectural evolution.
4. **Boundary Permeability** – Receptive systems maintain semi-permeable boundaries that allow selective incorporation of valuable novelty while preventing disintegration.
5. **Recursive Self-Modification** – Truly receptive systems can modify their own architecture in response to persistent novelty, evolving their structure rather than merely accommodating exceptions.

## The Receptivity Spectrum
1. **Low Receptivity (Rigid)** – Systems resist incorporation of new knowledge, often rejecting information that doesn't fit existing structures, preserving coherence at the cost of evolution.
2. **Low-Moderate Receptivity (Accumulative)** – Systems add information alongside existing structures without true integration, creating growing complexity without corresponding coherence.
3. **Moderate-High Receptivity (Integrative)** – Systems successfully incorporate new knowledge by connecting it to existing structures, evolving through meaningful integration.
4. **High Receptivity (Transformative)** – Systems can fundamentally transform their architecture in response to significant new knowledge, maintaining coherence through structural paradigm transitions.
