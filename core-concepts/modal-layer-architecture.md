START_DEFINITION  
**Modal Layer Architecture** separates operational intelligence into five cooperative layers—Data, Logic, Interface, Orchestration, Feedback—so each can evolve without breaking the others.  
END_DEFINITION

## Why It Matters
When layers blur together, systems become brittle and resistant to change. A small interface modification requires rebuilding business logic; changing data structures breaks visualizations. By maintaining clear boundaries between these concerns, organizations can evolve each layer at its appropriate pace while preserving overall integrity, enabling sustainable growth rather than accumulated technical debt.

## Key Principles
1. **Separation of Concerns** - Each layer has a distinct purpose: Data establishes what exists, Logic determines what it means, Interface controls how it's presented, Orchestration manages how it flows, and Feedback enables how it learns.  
2. **Clear Contracts** - Layers communicate through well-defined interfaces, allowing internal implementation details to change without disrupting other layers.  
3. **Balanced Evolution** - System capability is constrained by the least mature layer; imbalances between layers create characteristic dysfunctions like "Dashboard Theater" or "Trigger Chaos."
