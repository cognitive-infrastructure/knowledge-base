START_DEFINITION  
**Structure Debt** is the accumulated liability created when a system's underlying architecture—its data models, process flows, component boundaries, and governance rules—drifts out of alignment with the purposes it must serve. The debt manifests as brittleness, redundancy, and escalating integration costs; like financial interest, its "payments" appear as growing effort to make even minor changes.
END_DEFINITION

## Why It Matters
Structure Debt reframes architectural choices as an epistemic responsibility: poor structure obscures feedback, reducing a system's capacity to learn and adapt. Unlike code-level technical debt that primarily affects implementation details, structure debt fundamentally constrains what the system can know and do, creating an architectural ceiling that limits evolution regardless of heroic effort or technical proficiency at lower levels.

## Key Principles
1. **Architectural Misalignment** – The system's fundamental structures diverge from the core purposes they are meant to serve, creating cascading inconsistencies between intent and implementation.
2. **Progressive Rigidification** – What begins as flexibility hardens into constraint as accretions of patched structure make even simple changes require complex coordination across multiple subsystems.
3. **Integration Friction Acceleration** – The effort required to connect components grows non-linearly as structural inconsistencies compound, eventually dominating development and operational costs.
4. **Feedback Obstruction** – Poorly structured systems make it difficult to trace cause and effect, obscuring the signals that would normally guide adaptation and improvement.
5. **Emergent Liability Transfer** – Structure debt shifts liability from the system's visible mechanics to its invisible architecture, creating a gap between apparent stability and underlying fragility.

## Severity Gradient
1. **Latent** – Minor duplications in data fields or inconsistent entity definitions that create occasional confusion or extra work.
2. **Emergent** – Growing queue of "edge case" bugs and integration issues that reveal structural misalignments and boundary problems.
3. **Chronic** – Release velocity significantly impaired by regression testing and integration failures; teams develop extensive workarounds.
4. **Critical** – System becomes functionally unchangeable without major rebuild; teams bypass core components, creating parallel shadow systems.
