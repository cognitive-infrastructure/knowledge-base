START_DEFINITION  
**Friction Ontology** catalogs recurring patterns where intelligence systems resist clarity, providing a diagnostic taxonomy to identify structural issues from their symptoms, root causes, and characteristic impacts across different contexts.
END_DEFINITION

## Why It Matters
Without a shared vocabulary for clarity frictions, organizations tend to treat symptoms rather than causes, applying tactical fixes to strategic problems. The Friction Ontology enables pattern recognitionâ€”helping teams diagnose issues like "Dashboard Theater" or "Hero Syndrome" and apply appropriate structural remedies rather than perpetuating cycles of superficial intervention.

## Key Principles
1. **Frictions as Signals** - Each friction pattern indicates specific architectural tensions, not merely operational inefficiency. They reveal where evolution wants to occur.
2. **Universal Recurrence** - These patterns manifest across vastly different domains and technologies because they emerge from fundamental structural properties rather than specific implementations.
3. **Diagnostic Value** - Identifying the correct friction pattern provides immediate insight into appropriate remediation strategies and likely evolution paths.
4. **Structural Transformation** - Permanent resolution requires addressing the underlying architectural pattern rather than superficial symptoms, typically involving rebalancing modal layers.
