START_DEFINITION  
**Universal Evolutionary Stages** identify a recurring developmental sequence from pre-structural fragmentation through architectural standardization, semantic coherence, contextual adaptation, and ultimately to integrated intelligence—common across different domains of complexity.
END_DEFINITION

## Why It Matters
Different evolutionary stages require fundamentally different improvement approaches. Applying component-focused methods to architectural challenges or architectural approaches to component issues leads to wasted effort and limited progress. Understanding the current developmental stage helps organizations identify appropriate transformation strategies and avoid attempting advanced capabilities before establishing necessary foundations.

## Key Principles
1. **Stage 0-2: Foundation Building** - Initially progressing from operational fog (fragmented, undocumented activity) through basic digitization to simple workflow automation, with emphasis on capturing and connecting information.
2. **Stage 3-5: Architectural Coherence** - Advancing from scripted integration to structured data modeling and then semantic business logic, with focus on standardization, unified modeling, and consistent interpretation.
3. **Stage 6-8: Adaptive Intelligence** - Evolving from composable services through contextual intelligence to adaptive systems, enabling flexible recombination, context-aware operation, and continuous learning.
4. **Implementation Focus Shift** - As organizations progress through stages, emphasis shifts from component improvements to interface standardization and ultimately to architectural evolution.
