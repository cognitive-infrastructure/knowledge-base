START_DEFINITION  
**Coherence Debt** is the cumulative deficit in shared meaning, narrative alignment, and interpretive trust that arises when a system's data, language, or purpose diverges across its actors. It degrades decision quality and erodes collective intelligence even when the underlying mechanics still function.
END_DEFINITION

## Why It Matters
Coherence Debt frames meaning maintenance as a core organizational responsibility, showing how divergent interpretations can silently undermine collaboration despite functioning technical systems. Without intentional maintenance, the "information immune system" of an organization collapses, creating a widening trust gap that leads to duplicated efforts, misaligned decisions, and data skepticism that impairs collective intelligence.

## Key Principles
1. **Knowledge Externalization Deficit** – When shared meaning exists primarily in informal conversations rather than explicit structures, divergent interpretations proliferate across teams and time.
2. **Process Formalization Gap** – Without documented semantic standards, glossaries, and feedback loops, language evolution occurs unevenly, creating hidden rifts in understanding.
3. **Narrative Alignment Failure** – Strategic intent becomes fragmented as different teams operate with conflicting interpretations of goals, metrics, and priorities.
4. **Interpretive Trust Breakdown** – As metrics return different values from different sources, data skepticism grows, eroding trust in the informational foundation needed for collaboration.
5. **Decision Quality Degradation** – When people use the same terms to mean different things, the quality of cross-functional decisions degrades even while individual teams appear functional.

## Severity Gradient
1. **Latent** – Minor terminology mismatches that can be resolved through clarification but create conversational friction.
2. **Emergent** – Regular pings for clarification between teams; growing reliance on "translators" to bridge understanding.
3. **Chronic** – Strategic narratives diverge, with different departments operating on conflicting interpretations of core metrics and goals.
4. **Critical** – Complete interpretive breakdown; data is ignored wholesale as teams resort to siloed decision-making based on their local understanding.
