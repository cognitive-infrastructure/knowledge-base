START_DEFINITION  
**Role-Structure Coherence** addresses the essential relationship between responsibilities assigned to individuals or teams and the supporting scaffolding that enables those functionsâ€”revealing where architecture must evolve to support changing roles.
END_DEFINITION

## Why It Matters
Organizations frequently assign new responsibilities without corresponding structural support, creating accountability-authority gaps where people are responsible for outcomes they cannot influence. Conversely, they sometimes build sophisticated structures without clear role alignment, creating processes that nobody owns. Addressing these mismatches helps prevent both hero dependency and process orphaning.

## Key Principles
1. **Role Clarity vs. Rigidity** - Effective roles establish clear boundaries and expectations without constraining adaptation. Role clarity creates shared understanding about responsibilities and coordination; role rigidity creates brittle definitions that prevent evolution.
2. **Common Mismatches** - Several patterns indicate role-structure incoherence: the Accountability-Authority Gap (responsibility without control), the Expertise-Information Mismatch (specialized roles without access to needed information), and the Boundary-Interface Disconnect (clear domains without defined interaction points).
3. **Coherent Evolution** - When roles or structures change, the corresponding element must evolve synchronously. New responsibilities require supporting infrastructure; new tools and processes require clear ownership and accountability.
4. **Hero Dependency Remediation** - Converting individual-dependent processes into structurally supported systems requires externalizing tacit knowledge, creating structural memory, and developing transition paths that maintain capability while reducing dependency on specific individuals.
